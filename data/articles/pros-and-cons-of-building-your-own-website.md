## Businesses must have an online presence in this digital age; otherwise, they will be left behind.

Customers look for information on a company's website, social media profiles, and other resources to determine whether or not the company meets their needs. The absence of these elements can make a business appear less legitimate, resulting in potential customers and clients turning away from the company.

Hiring a website designer, on the other hand, will require you to spend money. That may not be something you are enthusiastic about doing.

> After all, small businesses operate on a limited financial basis. You might be wondering: Can you build your own website?

With all of the website design tools available on the internet, you might think creating a website is a straightforward process. You can indeed make a professional-looking website for free with a few simple clicks and drags.

However, given that your website is at the heart of your digital marketing strategy and plays a critical role in your overall success, your website must be much more than aesthetically pleasing.
Website builders have become increasingly popular among those who want to quickly and easily create a website for their business. Since its inception several years ago, website builders have progressed from being inexpensive to simple to use while also becoming more sophisticated in terms of dynamic features.

_So let's get to the bottom of the question: can you build your website?_

## The Pros of Using the Best Website Builder for Small Business

- You can save money. As a small business, it is important to make every dollar count. Using a website builder allows you to cut out a likely expensive website designer.

- You can make it happen on your schedule. Quality website designers are in high demand, so they may need to complete a few other projects before they can begin working on yours. Going the DIY route means you can get started right away.

- You'll be aware of what you're getting into. People who claim to be professional website designers—for example, freelancers without much of a portfolio—can occasionally be found to be amateurs in their field.

- Make use of feedback from people who are important to you. As you work, you'll have the opportunity to ask some of your most loyal customers to take a look at your site and provide you with feedback.

- You are the most knowledgeable person about your company, and you can put that knowledge to work in your website design. If you choose the right designer, they will understand your niche; however, the designer does not work for you or your company.

- You're going to learn something new. As adults, we rarely learn new skills or pursue new academic interests. If you have the necessary time and are committed to the design process, learn a great deal.

- If everything goes according to plan, you can be proud of your accomplishment. That is something that you will not be able to obtain by having someone else design your website.

## The Cons of Using the Website Builders for Small Businesses

- Although you'll save money in theory, it's important to remember that if your website isn't keeping up with the times or requires changes, it could end up costing you more money in the long run.

- One common criticism of website builders is that they rely excessively on the use of pre-designed templates. That is ideal for the inexperienced user who is only interested in a visually appealing website, but it can be frustrating for others that want a more complex and custom website.

- A lot of the customization options that web-savvy people enjoy are taken away by using templates. Website builders such as WordPress are more sensitive to this need, and they prioritize the ability to customize their sites.

- Your time would be better spent in another area. Even if you use drag and drop software to design a website, you should expect to put in several days of effort before having a page ready to be shared with the world.

- Professionalism is easily recognized by those who have witnessed it. Even the most excellent free templates tend to read to customers like canned goods. People are drawn to a website that is different from the rest.

- Search engine optimization is something designers are familiar with. While you may be familiar with the fundamentals, this is not something you should leave to chance, especially given the importance of search engine rankings and your company.

- DIY website builders are notorious for providing inaccurate website analytics. As analytics are at the heart of your digital marketing strategy, you'll want to make sure they're as precise as possible.

- Another issue that may arise is the time it takes for pages to load. When your website is hosted by a company that hosts many websites, it may not be as fast as you would like it to be for your customers.

- You should remember that 40 percent of people will abandon an online store if the site does not load within three seconds, so that a slow site can cost you customers. In some instances, web hosts have gone offline for several hours at a time, preventing their customers from accessing their websites.

- DIY websites do not include any form of customer service. Websites are prone to bugging out and need to be updated regularly. If you design your own website, you will be responsible for all fixes and updates, taking hours of work.

- Nothing on the internet remains the same for an extended period. You will need to keep up with security updates, new search engine guidelines, and design trends to make the necessary adjustments to your website.

- Websites and servers can crash, and when they do, they're gone for good unless they've been backed up first. The majority of DIY platforms do not provide this service.

## Which Web Design Services Should I Use?

When it comes down to it, there isn't a straightforward solution. Research and investigate the services that each web builder has to offer before making a decision. Make a list of the features and functions that you absolutely must have from your website builder. Is it necessary to provide hosting? Do you prefer simple templates, or do you want the ability to customize your website further? What is your financial situation? Do you require a web-based store?

> The fact that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to website design should not be overlooked.

Do you believe that creating your own website is the best option for you now that you have all the information?
